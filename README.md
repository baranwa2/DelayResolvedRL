# DelayResolvedRL
Implementation of the DRDQN algrotihm described in our CIKM'21 paper titled "Revisiting State Augmentation methods for Reinforcement Learning with Stochastic Delays"

## System requirements
<ul>
<li>Python 3.6.9</li>
<l1>Tensorflow 2.1</li>
<l1>OpenAI Gym 0.18.0</li>
</ul>
The repository includes experiemnts on standard Gym enviroments (and W-maze) with both constant and stochastic delays.
